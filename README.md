# 2wayAnova-in-R
This is an exemplar piece of work of how I conducted a 2wayAnova in R with a subsequent post hoc Tukey test.   
The post hoc Tukey test was particualrly challegning due to the subequent r plot function cutting of the y axis labels.   
I therefore had to create a workaround using ggplot which is effectively plotted the post hoc Tukey test in an eligble manner.
